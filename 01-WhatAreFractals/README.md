## Simetries

First, we got to know how symmetry happens on nature. Then we can understand the new kind of symmetry that fractals exhibit.

1. ### [Translational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry)

</div>

In geometry, to translate a geometric figure is to move it from one place to another without rotating it. A translation 'slides' a set A by adding x to every thing in A.

2. ### [Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry)

<div align="center">
  <img height="200px" src="../images/Symmetry.png" alt="Figures with the axes of symmetry drawn in. The figure with no axes is asymmetric." title="Figures with the axes of symmetry drawn in. The figure with no axes is asymmetric."/>

</div>

A figure which does not change upon undergoing a reflection has reflectional symmetry.

In 2D there is a line/axis of symmetry, in 3D, a plane of symmetry. An object or figure which is indistinguishable from its transformed image is called mirror symmetric. In conclusion, a line of symmetry splits the shape in half and those halves should be identical.

1. ### [Rotational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry)

<div align="center">
  <img height="200px" src="../images/Group_action_on_equilateral_triangle.svg" alt="Triangle with the radial axes of symmetry drawn in." title="Triangle with the radial axes of symmetry drawn in."/>

</div>

Rotational symmetry, also known as radial symmetry in biology, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn.

## Fractals structures

1. ### [Self-Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity)

<div align="center">
  <img height="200px" src="../images/KochSnowGif16_800x500_2.gif" alt="Koch curve infinitly zooming." title="Koch curve infinitly zooming."/>
</div>

A self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself. Self-similarity is one of the most common property of fractals. This feature is usually associated to [scale invariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance). The parts are similar to the whole.
