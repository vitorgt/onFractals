## Simetries

First, we got to know how symmetry happens on nature. Then we can understand the new kind of symmetry that fractals exhibit.

1. ### [Translational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry)

In geometry, to translate a geometric figure is to move it from one place to another without rotating it. A translation 'slides' a set A by adding x to every thing in A.

2. ### [Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry)

A figure which does not change upon undergoing a reflection has reflectional symmetry.

In 2D there is a line/axis of symmetry, in 3D, a plane of symmetry. An object or figure which is indistinguishable from its transformed image is called mirror symmetric. In conclusion, a line of symmetry splits the shape in half and those halves should be identical.

3. ### [Rotational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_symmetry)

<p align="center"><img src="images/Group_action_on_equilateral_triangle.svg" width="400" alt="Triangle with the radial axes of symmetry drawn in." title="Triangle with the radial axes of symmetry drawn in."/></p>

Rotational symmetry, also known as radial symmetry in biology, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn.

Those are basic structures of fractals
[What are Fractals](01-WhatAreFractals/README.md) is an introduction to some basic geometry of fractal sets, with emphasis on the Iterated Function System (IFS) formalism for generating fractals.
